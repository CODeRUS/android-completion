This is a Bash completion script for the "adb" command-line tool from the
Google Android SDK.  If you'd like to add completions for other Android tools,
please let me know.

Install
=======

Install bash-completion.  On many Linux distributions it is installed and
enabled by default.  If you don't have it already, you can probably find it in
your package repository (e.g. "aptitude install bash-completion").  Mac OS X
users can find it in Fink or MacPorts.

Copy the "android" file from this directory into the /etc/bash_completion.d
folder (under "/sw/etc" or "/opt/local/etc" on Mac OS X).

Restart your shell
